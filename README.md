This repository contains the regex manipulation scripts as well as the dataset used in the article "Evaluation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Systems Dealing with Misinformation in Portuguese" published in SIBGRAPI 2023 - Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images.

In this work we present the creation of a repository containing 52,525 synthetic images, generated with resources commonly found on digital platforms, and which contains disinformation presented in Portuguese, as well as an evaluation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. We hope it can be useful for studies in different contexts, such as containing and moderating misinformation. The dataset can be accessed by clicking [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8247981). DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8247981.

The "Regex Extractor" directory contains the script for manipulating the regex data. The "Generador-de-imagens-main" directory contains the scripts for producing and collecting statistical data from the repository as well as the FACTCK.BR textual repository embedded for inserting text in images.

  Abstract:
  
  With the emergence of social media and instant messaging applications, the dissemination of textual information through images has become increasingly popular. Concurrently, this type of media has been extensively exploited for spreading misinformation. Images with textual content possess several peculiar characteristics that pose numerous challenges for tools focused on content containment and moderation. In this context, we present a data repository namely ImageFactCK.BR. It contains 12,209 synthetic images generated with features commonly found on digital platforms, and that contain misinformation presented in the Portuguese language. We hope it can be useful for studies in different contexts.
